Building the Application
========================

You will first need to satisfy the build dependencies of Icon Set Forge before
compiling. You will need to install qmake for Qt 4 and Qt 4 Designer. On Debian
GNU/Linux and derivative systems, this can be done with the following command:

    # apt-get install qt4-qmake qt4-designer

You can compile the program using qmake and GNU make:

    $ cd Code/
    $ qmake-qt4
    $ make

Installing the Application
==========================

After compiling the program, you can execute the following from the Code
directory to install Icon Set Forge:

    # make install
