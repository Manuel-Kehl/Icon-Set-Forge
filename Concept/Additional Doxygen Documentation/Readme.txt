This directory contains additional data for doxygen, like separate documentation
files or descriptions, that are too long for in code placement.

I have chosen to maintain this directory on the master branch.
In my opinion doxygen comments are strictly bound to the code itself,
whereas for example doxygen's config file is only relevant on a 'meta level'.
